            <i>In our country</i>, there are more and more youngsters who graduate each year.<br> But companies are finding it really hard to identify right talents.</br> Most of the students that graduate fall under either first generation graduates OR from not so-good socio-economic background.

            They really do not know how to identify & target appropriate job roles.</br> They often end-up in jobs that don't deem fit for their ability.<br> Also, in search of fortune they move to metro/tier-1 cities like Chennai, Bangalore etc.,<br> where they have to spend a lot of money in getting trained in appropriate training programmes and end up in jobs (and ofcourse spend for their survival until they get a job).
